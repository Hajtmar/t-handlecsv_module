\usemodule[handlecsv]


\startbuffer[contents]
    \item \cB
\stopbuffer

\startbuffer[looknextemptyvalue]%
    \cA\ has the following values:
    
    \doloopuntil{\cA}{}{}%
\stopbuffer%


\startbuffer[letters]
\startitemize[n]
    \doloopwhile{\cA}{}{\getbuffer[contents]} 
\stopitemize

\stopbuffer


\starttext
\opencsvfile{letters.csv}

\resetlinepointer

First loop: 

\getbuffer[letters] % no any value when first line not meet the condition

No any value because first row not meet the condition.

Second loop: 

\getbuffer[looknextemptyvalue] % looking for a line that meets the condition
\getbuffer[letters] % and now print values until the condition is met

Third loop:

\getbuffer[looknextemptyvalue]  % now again looking for a line that meets the condition
\getbuffer[letters] % and again print values until the condition is met etc.


{\bf This example that shows, how you can go through the whole file:}

\resetlinepointer
\doloop{
\getbuffer[looknextemptyvalue]
\getbuffer[letters]
\ifEOF\exitloop\fi}

\stoptext
